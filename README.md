A genetic algorithm is a heuristic search method used in artificial intelligence and computing. It is used for finding optimized solutions to search problems based on the theory of natural selection and evolutionary biology. Genetic algorithms are excellent for searching through large and complex data sets. They are considered capable of finding reasonable solutions to complex issues as they are highly capable of solving unconstrained and constrained optimization issues.

I have implemented it in Java Programming language,whic makes it easy to understand.
